Introduction
This is the mini project in c programming, Telecom Billing System.In which we can perform and manage billing operations like they do in general telecom companies. In this program, we can add records with the name, phone, number, and amount of payment. here we can also modify, view, search and delete existing records. Here, we can make payments by providing your phone number instead of name. All data added or modified are recorded in a file. This project will teach you how to add, list, edit, search and delete records using file handling.
